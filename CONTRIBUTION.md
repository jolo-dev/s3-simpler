# Contribution

Thanks for contributing. In the following section, you will find how to set up s3-simpler (S4).

## Pre-requisite

- >= [NodeJs 18.x](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
- AWS account and use the environment variables
    - `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRETS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (when SSO)

## Getting Started

This project is generated by [projen](https://github.com/projen/projen/) and is using its [Typescript Project](https://projen.io/typescript.html).

### Install

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Tests

Run all tests. This works only when AWS credentials are provided.

```sh
pnpm test
```

Run just unit tests

```sh
pnpm test:unit
```

Run just integration tests. This works only when AWS credentials are provided.

```sh
pnpm test:integration
```

Run the vitest UI.

```sh
pnpm vitest:ui
```

## Linting and Formatting (Checking)

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) to format and lint.

```sh
pnpm lint
```

This runs a [safe](https://biomejs.dev/linter/#safe-fixes) fix linting. If not everything is formatted but after reviewing you see it is fine, you can run 

```sh
pnpm lint:unsafe
```

Usually, this is sufficient to format and lint at the same time.
